# Dominguez Family Thanksgiving Menu

This repository hosts a small static site for the Dominguez family Thanksgiving dinner.

The site is designed to be served via **GitHub Pages** and opened by guests using a **QR code** at the table.

## How it works

- `index.html` is a single-page site with:
  - An **Adult Menu** tab
  - A **Kids Menu** tab
- It is mobile-friendly and works great on phones and tablets.

## GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repo.
2. Set:
   - Source: **main**
   - Folder: **/** (root)
3. Save.

Your site will be available at:

```text
https://dominguezbernaldo943-svg.github.io/thanksgiving-menu/
```

Use that URL to generate your QR code.
